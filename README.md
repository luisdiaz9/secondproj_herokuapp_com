The dashboard shows the flight information scraped from different websites on a chosen day. The
scatter plot displays a price comparison between airlines whilst the map draws the distance
between destinations for determining the degree to which the two variables&#39; movements are
associated. A search engine breaks down every item in the database such as the most current
exchange rate obtained from the Banxico API. Tools used: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Flask and
SQLite.
